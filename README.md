# Clue-Game
***
### As a high school student, I have many fond memories of playing the board game Clue, in which the players race against one another to find out who killed Mr. Boddy, with what weapon, in what room. However, in the age of Covid, in-person get-togethers are seen as more controversial than in the past and not everyone has the table space for a physical board. In this game you race against a computer, rather than another player, to find the killer.

### First, you must move your character to a room to make a suggestion. To do this, fill in the "Room" field of the form, then click the move button. Once there, you suggest the murder took place in the room you are currently in, filling in the suspect and weapon fields appropriately. You will learn if your guess is right or not. If your guess is wrong, cross off the parts you got wrong in your detective notebook. Once you have only 1 suspect, 1 weapon, and 1 room left, make an accusation in the room where it happened. If you get it right, you win! But beware, an incorrect accusation will get you thrown out of the mansion (and the game).
